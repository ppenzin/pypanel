 PyPanel v2.0 Copyright (c) 2003-2004 Jon Gelo (ziljian@users.sourceforge.net)
 Distributed under the GNU General Public License v2, see COPYING for details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PyPanel is a lightweight panel/taskbar written in Python and C for X11 window
managers.  It can be easily customized to match any desktop theme or taste.
PyPanel works with WindowMaker and EWMH compliant WMs (Kahakai, Openbox, FVWM,
PekWM, etc). 

The panel displays currently running tasks/applications and can also be
configured to display the current desktop name, date/time and a system tray
(notification area).

When the panel is minimized, either manually or by autohide, it can be restored
by moving the mouse over the top or bottom of the screen where the panel was
displayed prior to minimization.

All image rendering (icons and background transparency/tinting) is handled by
Imlib2.

The handling of button events on the panel objects is handled by the 
~/.pypanelrc configuration file.  The file is a python script which gets 
imported/executed when PyPanel is invoked, ensure it contains proper Python
formatting and no syntax errors or the panel will not start!
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Requirements (Minimum versions)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Python v2.2                  http://www.python.org
2. Python X Library v0.12       http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net
3. Imlib2 v1.1.1                http://www.enlightenment.org/pages/imlib2.html
4. libXft v1.0 (optional)       http://fontconfig.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Installation (Upgrading) & Starting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. python setup.py install
2. pypanel &
3. If upgrading to 2.0, you'll need to replace/merge your current 
   ~/.pypanelrc with the new version:
 
   a. Move your current ~/.pypanelrc to a backup location or backup name
   b. Start PyPanel so a new ~/.pypanelrc is created
   c. Kill the panel process
   d. Merge any changes you wish to keep from your backup config to the
      new version

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Uninstallation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PyPanel installs the following files -

1. /usr/bin/pypanel (may be in /usr/local/bin or other depending on system)
2. <path to your Python library>/site-packages/ppmodule.so (.sl)
3. <path to your Python library>/site-packages/pypanel/
4. ~/.pypanelrc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Configuration is handled via the ~/.pypanelrc python script, it's
   'executed' when PyPanel is started.
2. If the level of customization from the config script isn't enough, hack
   the PyPanel script itself.

                                 Contributions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. My sincerest thanks to the many PyPanel users who have shared their ideas,
   suggestions, comments, code snippets and overall support for this project.
2. The default app icon included with this distribution is from the Amaranth
   icon set by Michael Doches.  Available from http://www.kde-look.org
